1. Airports
2. Analysis:
- I looked at Altitude and Country
- There are 7,698 airports in this dataset.  The mean altitude is 1015.87 feet above sea level, the median altitude is 352 feet, the lowest altitude is -1266 feet, and the highest altitude is 14472 feet.  The range of altitudes is 15738 feet.  For altitude, Q1 is 63, and Q3 is 1203, so the IQR is 1140.  Standard deviation of altitude is 1628.78.  There are 237 countries in this dataset.  The United States has the most airports, at 1512.
- I examined the relationship between country and altitude, by graphing the average altitudes of all the countries. The mean average altitude is 872.37 feet, which is lower than the mean altitude measured before combining all the airports from each country.  The maximum average altitude is Lesotho, at 5851 feet.  The lowest average altitude is Kiribati, at 4.6 feet.  The median average altitude is 411.1 feet.  The IQR is 1078.7, Q1 is 80.5, and Q3 is 1159.2.  The standard deviation is 1158.
- There are 237 countries on this dataset, so the visualization is a bit busy.  However, zooming in helps a lot.  The bar graph printed by my code orders the countries on the y axis from the highest average altitude to the lowest, and the length of the bars correspond to a measurement in feet on the x axis.
3. The lowest 25 average altitudes are all island countries.  This supports the conclusion that airports on island countries are more likely to have lower altitude that airports on inland countries.  Other than that, it's interesting to see where certain countries lie on this graph, especially considering that average airport altitude doesn't necessarily have to do with the actual average altitude of a country.  For example, Nepal, which is known for its towering mountain ranges, is actually lower on the graph than Afghanistan, which is known for its wide deserts.

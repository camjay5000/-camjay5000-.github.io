#### Analyze and question the data that the scientists use.
This research was conducted as an experiment, as opposed to retrospectively.  This means that the data, in order to achieve a higher p-value, could have been manipulated.  This experiment studied the effectiveness of a light therapy treatment to dissolve beta-amyloid plaques that are belived to cause Alzheimer's disease.  This was tested using mice.  However, mice can't actually have Alzheimer's disease, so these mice had the rodent equivalent for the disease.  In collecting the data, the researchers worked to make sure that there were no other factors influencing the result of the study.  The paper notes that no animals were excluded from the analysis, which is a good sign that might mean that no data was omitted in the analysis, making the study more trustworthy.  The data itself is extremely thorough, and although I don't understand most of it, the researchers seem to have taken a very objective approach to the experiment, making sure that they were not biased.

#### Analyze their results. Do you trust their findings? Why or why not?
Yes, I trust their findings.  Obviously not solely because of their results, as I can't know whether or not the findings were objective unless I replicate the study.  Another part of the study that proves reliability is the researchers behind it.  This study was a collaboration between researchers from the Picower Institute of Learning and Memory at MIT and other MIT researchers.  The director, Li-Huei Tsai, has been studying the brain for almost three decades, and the same can be said for all of the other researchers.  However, because I don't really understand what is going on in the results, I can't tell whether or not I trust the research, and I also can't replicate the study, so until the study has been scrutinized and successfully replicated, it can't be fully trusted.

#### How might "publish or perish" have affected this study?
Publish or perish definitely played a part in this study.  The conclusion itself, that there is a simple cure for Alzheimer's disease that can be downloaded as an app on an iPad, is very exciting, which definitely plays a part in the success of the study.  They will secure more investment, gain more positive press, and the study will be widely published and praised simply because of that conclusion.  This may have been part of the motivation from the beginning, but the question at this point is whether or not they chased that consclusion in order to secure all that press and recognition.  In the end, however, if this revolutionary finding can be proven, then this is truly groundbreaking work.

###### *Vitamin D Supplementation Improves Cognitive Function Through Reducing Oxidative Stress Regulated by Telomere Length in Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment: A 12-Month Randomized Controlled Trial*

#### 1. Identify a statistical question that you could ask.
Can Vitamin D prevent future cognitive impairment in younger adults?
#### 2. Identify the population you would study to answer the question. What information about the population would help answer your question?
Adults ranging from ages 30 to 60 years old. Age, race, socioeconomic status, predisposition to cognitive decline, other health issues, gender, education
#### 3. Identify a feasible sample frame, and explain your reasoning.
A large group of adults ranging from ages 30 to 60 years old, with varying age, race, socioeconomic status, predisposition to cognitive decline, other health issues, gender, and education.  All these factors can affect the effects of cognitive decline on a person, so to be able to control for these factors later on, they must be represented in the sample frame.
#### 4. Identify the sampling method you would use, and explain your reasoning. What makes this method better than the others?
Interval sampling.  There are a lot of factors here, so they would have to be considered when choosing an experimental group.  Interval sampling allows for those variables to be controlled for, and will ultimately produce a group that is very close to a perfect representation of the population.  Stratified sampling would produce a similar result, but it is simply more difficult to calculate, so interval sampling is ideal.
#### 5. Suppose you had the means to run an experiment on this sample. Identify the null and alternative hypotheses.
Null: Vitamin D does not have any effect on cognitive impairment in adults.
Alternative: Vitamin D prevents cognitive impairment in adults.
#### 6. Identify the variables and treatments that would provide information about your question. Explain your choice of treatments.
The independent variable is whether or not Vitamin D is administered, and the dependent variable is cognitive decline.  One group would be given a recommended daily dose of Vitamin D, and the other group would be given no supplementary Vitamin D.  If all other factors are successfully controlled for, the two groups should be, on average, identical.  The treatment choice would be effective because, assuming we already know what the ideal daily Vitamin D dosage is, we can then test if people who take Vitamin D daily are at less risk of cognitive decline than people who do not take Vitamin D.
#### 7. Identify the treatment groups, and how each subject would be assigned to a group.
There would be two treatment groups: one group would be given a recommended daily dose of Vitamin D, and the other group would be given no supplementary Vitamin D.  Because this study uses interval sampling, we can choose an appropriate interval, and from two different starting points, create two experimental groups.
#### 8. Briefly discuss how the experiment would be conducted.
The Vitamin D group would be given their recommended daily dose of Vitamin D every day, and the control group would not be given any supplementary Vitamin D.  This study would be performed over 30 years in order to see any results.  Once a year, each participant would take a cognitive test in order to track the effects of the treatment on their cognitive decline.  After 30 years, a conclusion can be drawn from the recorded data.
#### 9. What biases may come up, and how would you address them?
Even though participants are taking the cognitive test only once a year, it is still possible that they can improve simply through practice and familiarity.  The study isn't double blinded, so there is a possibility of the placebo effect, as well as rater bias, where the people doing the rating, who are conscious of the experimental conditions for each person, are subconsciously manipulating the results.  If the sample frame isn't representative of the population, there would be a selection bias.  Also, assuming Vitamin D is definitely good for you, barring people from taking it is unethical.

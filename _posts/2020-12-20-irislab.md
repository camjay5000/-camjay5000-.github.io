1. Iris-virginica has the longest petals on average.
2. Iris-setosa has the widest sepals on average.

#### Here's how the code works:
* [iris.csv gets read and translated into a list called data_list.](https://imgur.com/a/NpLnxvA)
* [Next, three lists are populated with values from data_list.](https://imgur.com/a/KdV65hZ)
* [Then, the averages of each of these three lists are calculated.](https://imgur.com/a/KoQsLLA)
* [Finally, we can tell which of these three averages has the highest value.](https://imgur.com/a/EV1TpKl)
* This can be repeated for any of the four values.

#### Here's how I got there:
* I started off with my code from the reading data homework.
* This code, while a good place to start, didn't calculate any averages.
* When doing averages, I ran into a couple of issues.
* First, data_list was composed of string elements, not int elements, so I had to use float()
* Next, my actual average() method wasn't working correctly, so I had to figure out a simpler way of accomplishing the same task. The current average() method is very simple, yet effective.
* Once those issues were ironed out, the code could then figure out the largest averaged value.
* The second half of the code is basically exactly the same as the first half, except it uses new lists and variables. The main difference is that instead of looking at data_list's row[2] (petal-length), it looks at row[1] (sepal-width).

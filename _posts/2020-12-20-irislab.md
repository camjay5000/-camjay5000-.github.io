## Iris Lab
#### Mazyar Azmi

1. Iris-virginica has the longest petals on average.
2. Iris-setosa has the widest sepals on average.

#### Here's how the code works:
* [iris.csv gets read and translated into a list called data_list.](https://imgur.com/a/NpLnxvA)
* [Next, three lists are populated with values from data_list.](https://imgur.com/a/KdV65hZ)
* [Then, the averages of each of these three lists are calculated.](https://imgur.com/a/KoQsLLA)
* [Finally, we can tell which of these three averages has the highest value.](https://imgur.com/a/EV1TpKl)
* This can be repeated for any of the four values.

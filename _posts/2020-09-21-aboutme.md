###My name is Mazyar Azmi. Nice to meet you.  
#####Here's some things you should know about me.

* I am *almost* 17 years old.
* I have two dogs.
* I like cars.

Still interested? Good.

#### Experience with Computer Science:

1. First, I took CS1.

This was in the summer before my freshman year.  
Also, I wasn't entirely unexperienced, as I had some prior arduino experience.

2. Then, I took CS2 in 10th grade.

This was **_very_** fun.  
I learned Java and Python.

3. Now, I am taking Art of Data.

I _cannot wait_ to learn more!

I am also taking Pre Calculus AB, and I haven't taken any statistics courses yet.  However, I have taken Science Research, where I learned a lot about data, statistical significance, etc.

#### My Car:

With my dad and my brother, I am building a [Factory Five MK4 Roadster](https://www.factoryfive.com/roadster/mk4/). This kit car is a replica of a [1965 Shelby Cobra, built by Carroll Shelby](https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/carroll-shelby-ap-aa-191114_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg). We have been working on it for three years, and it should be completely finished by next summer.  Currently, the car is in a "go-kart stage" because the engine runs and it can move, but it isn't finalized yet.

The engine is a [Blueprint 347](https://imgur.com/a/981YjaI) with 411 hp and 430 lb/ft of torque.  In such a light car, this engine will really pull. 

The car has a very light fiberglass body, and will be painted in [Viking Blue with Wimbledon White stripes](https://www.ffcars.com/attachments/lightblue-jpg.311610/).

#### Something I'm looking forward to:

The fencing season, if it happens. I really want to win overall this season! If it doesn't end up happening, then I'm looking forward to next year's season. I also got a [new blade](https://www.leonpaulusa.com/media/catalog/product/cache/3/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/p/r/project-zer0-foil-corrected-blade.jpg), so I can't wait to really use it!
